     - Used the Bayesian Dirichlet Equivalent Uniform to inference underlying latent relationships between variables.

**Note**: During my time at NC State, I wanted to enrich my knowledge beyond what I was learning in class and within Prof. Franzon's lab. To do this, I joined two additional labs: the low-resource computing lab under Prof. Jung-Eun Kim in the CS department and Sozzani lab under Prof. Ross Sozzani in the Microbial Biology department. I **concurrently** produced research for all three labs while balancing my responsibilities as a student, junior advisor, teaching assistant, and research/grant proposal writer. <u>I have manuscripts being prepared; contact me for details.</u>
