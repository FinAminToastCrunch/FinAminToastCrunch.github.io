## Publications

1. **[Real-Time Vessel Segmentation for Ultra-Sound Guided Surgery](null)**  
   Feb 2024 - Ongoing  
   Published as second author in High Performance Extreme Computing (HPEC '24). Supervised by MIT-LL  
   - Investigated various pruning/quantization techniques for real-time image segmentation of human vessels.
   - Contributed to writing a custom application for evaluating performance on a mobile AI system.
   - Motivated the processing of tomographic segmentation algorithms from a discrete computer to a mobile AI system in the next generation of [AI Guide](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/other/doc/2023-02/TVO_Technology_Highlight_15_AIGUIDE.pdf).

2. **[Large Reasoning Models for 3D Floorplanning in EDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10538)**  
   Aug 2023 - Ongoing  
   Under review, submitted as first author. Supervised by Qualcomm Fellowship and Prof. Franzon  
   - Developed Dreamweaver, an auto-regressive decision-making model to optimize 3D IC floorplanning, significantly improving computational efficiency and scalability.
   - Implemented an architecture that integrates sequence-to-sequence reinforcement learning algorithms, enhancing the model's ability to reason over large discrete action spaces.
   - Achieved notable improvements in sample efficiency and floorplan quality by training the model using non-expert trajectories and implementing a novel reinforcement framework.
   - Evaluated the model against the SOTA, demonstrating superior performance in reducing wirelength and understanding complex multi-objective optimization tasks.

3. **[The Over-Certainty Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16168)**  
   Sept 2022 – Ongoing  
   Under review, submitted as first author, supervised by Prof. Jung-Eun Kim  
   - Introduced a novel memory-efficient unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm (UDA) which improves calibration.
   - Identified key issues in state-of-the-art UDA algorithms which harm model calibration.
   - Retained comparable accuracy to SOTA.

4. **[Can Low-Rank Knowledge Distillation be Useful for Microelectronic Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13808)**  
   March 2024 - May 2024  
   Published as co-first author, LLM-Aided Design (LAD '24)  
   - Presented empirical results on the feasibility of using offline LLMs in EDA.
   - Evaluated Llama-2-7B's performance as a microelectronics Q&A expert, focusing on its reasoning and problem-solving abilities.
   - Introduced a novel LLM adaptation technique, low-rank knowledge distillation (LoRA-KD).
   - Released an evaluation benchmark to support future research.

5. **[Optimal Brain Dissection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379275)**  
   May 2022 – Aug 2023  
   Published as first author in BioInspired Processing (BIP '23), supervised by Sozzani Lab and USDA  
   - Won Best Paper award.
   - Introduced a SOTA technique for feature-importance determination.
   - Developed the dense autoencoder, a new autoencoder architecture for reducing reconstruction error in -omics data.
   - Outperformed the *de facto* gene regulatory network with respect to explaining gene expressions.  
   During my time at NC State, I wanted to enrich my knowledge beyond what I was learning in class and within Prof. Franzon's lab. To do this, I joined two additional labs: the low-resource computing lab under Prof. Jung-Eun Kim in the CS department and Sozzani lab under Prof. Ross Sozzani in the Microbial Biology department. I concurrently produced research for all three labs while balancing my responsibilities as a student, junior advisor, teaching assistant, and research/grant proposal writer. I have manuscripts being prepared; contact me for details.

6. **[DepthGraphNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10299839)**  
   Oct 2022 – July 2023  
   Published as first author in Machine Learning for Computer Aided Design (MLCAD '23)  
   - Investigated the use of siamese-graph neural networks for circuit graph isomorphism (CGI) detection.
   - Showed logarithmic run-time complexity with respect to graph size.
   - Outperformed all other classical and neural methods in CGI detection accuracy.
   - Introduced theorems for the optimal architecture of GNNs for CGI detection.

7. **[Network Inference Approach for Phosphoproteomics](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-3327-4_27)**  
   May 2022 – Nov 2022  
   Published as co-first author in Methods in Molecular Biology (MIMB vol. 2690), supervised by Sozzani Lab  
   - Described methods to statistically analyze label-free phosphoproteomic data and infer post-transcriptional regulatory networks over time.
   - Used the Bayesian Dirichlet Equivalent Uniform to inference underlying latent relationships between variables.
