## Welcome to my (mostly) research page!

Hi! I am Fin, a part-time PhD student at NC State that is working as an electrical engineering intern at MIT Lincoln Lab. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was honored to be a Terry Foundation Scholar. Later, I received the Qualcomm Fellowship along with other awards during my PhD studies at North Carolina State University under Prof. Paul Franzon. I am fortunate to have produced research with numerous labs across NC State, Harvard and MIT. My Google Scholar isn't always up to date; please consult my CV for my publications. 

In my spare time I really enjoy playing soccer. My full first name is "Shafin" which in Arabic means "medical doctor"... my parents really wanted me to be a physician. Also, I really like neurodivergent people; if you're someone that needs help navigating a life situation, please feel free to reach out! I am still putting this page together so if you see any issues please email me :D
