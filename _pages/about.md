## Welcome to my (mostly) research page!

Hi! I am Fin, a grad student in engineering. Fun fact, my full first name is "Shafin." Shafin, in Arabic means "medical doctor"... my parents really wanted me to be a physician. I am still putting this page together so if you see any issues please email me :D

Also, another cool fact about me, I have an Erdos number of 4!
