## Welcome to my (mostly) research page!

Hi! I am Fin, a PhD student on a sabbatical to work as an electrical engineering intern at MIT Lincoln Lab. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was honored to be a Terry Foundation Scholar. Later, I received the Qualcomm Fellowship to support my PhD studies at North Carolina State University! I am extremely fortunate to have produced research with numerous labs across NC State, Harvard and MIT. My Google Scholar isn't always up to date; please consult my CV for my publications. 

I have an Erdos number of 4! My full first name is "Shafin." Shafin, in Arabic means "medical doctor"... my parents really wanted me to be a physician. I am still putting this page together so if you see any issues please email me :D
